# Spam SMS classification

In **Project 4 of Oasis Infobyte Data Science Internship**, I've ventured into the realm of SMS classification as spam or ham, employing the power of Natural Language Processing (NLP). This exploration involves classic machine learning algorithms like `Naive Bayes` and `Random Forest`, along with diving into the deep end with `LSTM`, `GRU`, `BidirectionalLSTM`, and `Conv1d` for a comprehensive analysis. Uncovering the patterns of SMS content, these algorithms showcase their strengths in discerning between spam and legitimate messages, adding an exciting layer of sophistication to the project.
